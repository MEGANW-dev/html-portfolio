<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Megan! I am an aspiring Web Developer with an acquired interested in game development thanks to my constant growing passion for gaming.
  This is my first website built with just some html basics allowing me to understand the general concept of building a website, as I continue my learning in other languages such as 
  C++ and Python, I plan to gradually expand, improve and add my projects to the website i've created. I hope the result of my work showcases the dedication I posses to this career path 
  and profession as it is something I genuinely enjoy! 

<p>Most people tell you not to hold your breath, but I will! I've got some incredible concepts and ideas for not only web applications, but mobile as well. I hope that you stick 
  around long enough to watch my work and dedication evolve
